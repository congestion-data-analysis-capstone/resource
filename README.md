This instruction shows you how to make your branch and merge it to a group gitHub.

Phase 1 – Clone the group gitHub:
-	Clone the group GitHub

Phase 2a – Make your branch
-	Before making the development branch, please do 

	$git pull origin master

-	Make your branch with convention of using your ucsd login name

	$git checkout -b mqh001_branch_name

Phase2b – Add your branch to gitHub
-	When you are ready to add your changes to GitHub, do this

	$git add directory/file

	$git commit –m “Add change for xxx”

	$git push
             
    Please note when you are done this step, your branch is up on GitHub but it is on its own branch

Phase 3: Merge your branch to the master branch.   Currently this instruction shows you on GitHub UI which has nice UI for merging.

-	Use UI to do pull.
-	Check for conflict
-	Merge

Finally, check your work on the master branch to ensure it successfully merged.
